title: CybOX Maturity Spectrum
---

To help the broader community and ourselves assess the current state of CybOX, we've developed a three-tiered “maturity spectrum” for categorizing the major entities and their corresponding models. This is based on two factors:

* The semantic completeness/accuracy of the model around the entity, as well as the sense of community agreement/disagreement with regards to the data model.
* The use of the model (through serialization) in existing implementations.

### Metric

#### High (green)
* **Semantic consensus**: Little to no known semantic issues. Virtually no disagreement about the data model in the community.
* **Existing use**: Widely used in existing implementations.

#### Medium (yellow)
* **Semantic consensus**: Several minor known semantic issues, or one or two larger issues. Some level of disagreement about the data model in the community.
* **Existing use**: Some known use in existing implementations.

#### Low (red)
* **Semantic consensus**: One or more major known semantic issues. Significant disagreement about the data model in the community.
* **Existing use**: Little to no known use in existing implementations.
