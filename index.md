# What is it?
 [CybOX is a standard](http://cybox.mitre.org/language/) implemented as an [XML schema ](https://github.com/CybOXProject/schemas) that captures `Observable` content about an indicator.

It enables people to [share signatures](http://cybox.mitre.org/about/faqs.html#A1) about malicious files and attacks via automated means.

# How do I use it?
Check the [samples](https://github.com/CybOXProject/schemas/tree/master/samples) for common use cases

See the Python-oriented [Quick Start Guide ](/quickstart)

Read up on [Best Practices](/suggestions) 

# How do I create indicators?
Community triage tools [support CybOX output ](https://github.com/stephenbrannon/IOCextractor)

Parsing your incoming [phishing and spam emails](https://github.com/CybOXProject/email-to-cybox) is easy

Conversion to [Mandiant OpenIOC format](https://github.com/CybOXProject/openioc-to-cybox) is supported

# Can I export to other formats?
We support the [MITRE OVAL standard](https://github.com/CybOXProject/cybox-to-oval) which is natively accepted by many security products.

If you want [plain vanilla HTML ](https://github.com/CybOXProject/cybox-to-html) that is fine too.
