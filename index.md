# Impetus
[CybOX is a standard for representing data](http://cybox.mitre.org/language/) implemented as an [XML schema ](https://github.com/CybOXProject/schemas) 

It enables [sharing of sanitized data](http://cybox.mitre.org/about/faqs.html#A1) about malicious files observed by an organization

# Implementation
See the [Quick Start Guide ](/quickstart) and [developer documentation](http://cybox.readthedocs.org.)

Read up on [Suggested Practices](/suggestions) 

Check out some [common use cases](https://github.com/CybOXProject/schemas/tree/master/samples) 

# How do I translate my data to CybOX?
You can [transform incoming emails ](https://github.com/CybOXProject/email-to-cybox) to share phishing attempts

Host-based logs can be converted from [OpenIOC format](https://github.com/CybOXProject/openioc-to-cybox) and other [open source tools ](https://github.com/stephenbrannon/IOCextractor)

# Can I export to other formats?
We support the [MITRE OVAL standard](https://github.com/CybOXProject/cybox-to-oval) which is natively accepted by many security products.

[Vanilla HTML output](https://github.com/CybOXProject/cybox-to-html) is also supported
