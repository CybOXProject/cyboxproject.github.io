##OASIS Transition
[DHS](http://www.dhs.gov/office-cybersecurity-and-communications/) is transitioning CybOX, [STIX](https://github.com/STIXProject/), and [TAXII](https://github.com/TAXIIProject/) to [Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS)](https://www.oasis-open.org/), a non-profit consortium that drives the development, convergence, and adoption of open standards for the global information society, in May 2015.
