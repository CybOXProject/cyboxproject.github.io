##OASIS Transition
[DHS](http://www.dhs.gov/office-cybersecurity-and-communications/) is transitioning CybOX, [STIX](https://github.com/STIXProject/), and [TAXII](https://github.com/TAXIIProject/) to [Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS)](https://www.oasis-open.org/), a non-profit consortium that drives the development, convergence, and adoption of open standards for the global information society, in May 2015.

##Discussion List & Archive
OASIS will host a new STIX Discussion List and Archives once the transition is completed in July 2015. The pre-transition Discussion List Archives will also be retained. Once the OASIS list is operational, information about it will be posted here. Information on joining the existing list (soon to be defunct) can be found [here](http://cybox.mitre.org/community/registration.html).
