##OASIS Transition
[DHS](http://www.dhs.gov/office-cybersecurity-and-communications/) has transitioned CybOX, [STIX](https://github.com/STIXProject/), and [TAXII](https://github.com/TAXIIProject/) to [Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS)](https://www.oasis-open.org/), a non-profit consortium that drives the development, convergence, and adoption of open standards for the global information society. The [Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Technical Committee (TC)] (https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti) now leads the ongoing development of these standards. Organizations and individuals that wish to play a regular and active role in the shaping of these standards should consider joining OASIS and the CTI TC.

###Transition Information
The following resources provide addition information about the transition of these standards to OASIS:

* [Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Technical Committee (TC)](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti)

##Discussion Lists & Archives
Everything that the CTI TC does is public and the discussions around the evolution of the specifications are no exception. Therefore, all archived discussions on the public mailing lists for the CTI TC overall as well as for the individual subcommittees are available for access by anyone at the following links:

* [CTI TC Discussion List Archive](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti/)
* [CTI-STIX Subcommittee List Archive](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti-stix/)
* [CTI-TAXII Subcommittee List Archive](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti-taxii/)
* [CTI-CybOX Subcommittee List Archive](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti-cybox/)

###CTI Users List
A new mailing list, cti-users@lists.oasis-open.org, has been created that is intended for discussing topics related to the effective use of STIX/TAXII/CybOX and the development of solutions that use these standards.  Unlike the other CTI TC lists, this list will be open to anyone to join and post to.
 
If you are interested in joining the cti-users list you will need to explicitly subscribe.  You may do that by sending a blank email message to [cti-users-subscribe@lists.oasis-open.org](mailto:cti-users-subscribe@lists.oasis-open.org) and then replying to the list server's email response requesting confirmation.


###Public Comment List
Organizations and individuals who are not OASIS CTI TC members can provide comments to the CTI TC via the CTI TC Public Comment List:

* [Subscribe to Submit Your Comments](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/comments/form.php?wg_abbrev=cti)
* [Archive](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti-comment/)
