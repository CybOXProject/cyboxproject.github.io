With the transition of STIX, TAXII and CybOX to OASIS, the evolution of those specifications are taking place within the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Technical Committee (TC).   Organizations and individuals that wish to play a regular and active role in the shaping of these standards either have joined or should consider joining OASIS and the CTI TC.  However, it is also important to us that organizations and individuals that, for whatever reason, are not in a position to join OASIS at this time have an ability to track the evolution of the specifications and all of the discussions that are taking place.  Everything that the CTI TC does is public and the discussions around the evolution of the specifications are no exception.  Therefore, all archived discussions on the public mailing lists for the CTI TC overall as well as for the individual subcommittees are available for access by anyone at the following links:
