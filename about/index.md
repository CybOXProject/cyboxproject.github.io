## The Challenge
The concept of observable events or properties in the operational cyber realm is a central underlying element of many of the different activities involved in cyber security. Today, there exists no uniform standard mechanism for specifying, capturing, characterizing or communicating these cyber observables. Each activity area, each use case and often each supporting tool vendor uses its own unique approach that inhibits consistency, efficiency, interoperability and overall situational awareness.

## What is CybOX?
The Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOXâ„¢) is a standardized language for encoding and communicating high-fidelity information about cyber observables. CybOX is not targeted at a single cyber security use case but rather is intended to be flexible enough to offer a common solution for all cyber security use cases requiring the ability to deal with cyber observables. It is also intended to be flexible enough to allow both the high-fidelity description of instances of cyber observables that have been measured in an operational context as well as more abstract patterns for potential observables that may be targets for observation and analysis apriori. By specifying a common structured schematic mechanism for these cyber observables, the intent is to enable the potential for detailed automatable sharing, mapping, detection and analysis heuristics.

Through utilization of the standardized CybOX language, relevant observable events or properties can be captured and shared, defined in indicators and rules or used to adorn the appropriate portions of attack patterns and malware profiles in order to tie the logical pattern constructs to real-world evidence of their occurrence or presence for attack detection and characterization. Incident response and management can then take advantage of all of these capabilities to investigate occurring incidents, improve overall situational awareness and improve future attack detection, prevention and response.

## What can CybOX do?

- Threat intelligence
- Malware characterization
- Security operations
- SIEM / Logging
- Incident response
- Indicator sharing
- Digital forensics

>  CybOX allows organizations to share indicators and detections for incoming computer network attacks in a standard format.
