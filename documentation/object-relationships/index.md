title: Object Relationships
---

This page contains a detailed listing of the available CybOX Object â†’ Object
relationships, and adds some additional context for each relationship. This
includes a richer definition, a listing and description of the Objects that the
relationship is most applicable to, its inverse (if existing), and an example
XML snippet that demonstrates the relationship in use.


## <a name="Created"></a> "Created"

The **source Object** *Created* the **related Object**. Applicable to a wide range of Objects, particularly in the context of a Process that creates other Objects.
