title: Object Relationships
---

This page contains a detailed listing of the available CybOX Object â†’ Object
relationships (from the [ObjectRelationshipVocab-1.1](http://stixproject.github.io/data-model/1.1.1/cyboxVocabs/ObjectRelationshipVocab-1.1/) vocabulary), and adds some additional context for each relationship. This includes a richer definition,
a listing and description of the Objects that the relationship is most applicable
to, its inverse (if existing), and an example XML snippet that demonstrates the
relationship in use.
